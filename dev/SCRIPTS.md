## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Docker Compose not found**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is installed
   - Try using `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`

2. **Services won't start**
   - Check if ports are already in use
   - Ensure Docker has enough resources allocated

3. **Database connection issues**
   - Wait for database to be ready (15-30 seconds)
   - Check if database container is running

4. **Permission issues (Linux/Mac)**
   - Make scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running

### Getting Help:

```bash
# Show development helper help
./dev.sh help

# Check service status
./dev.sh status

# View service logs
./dev.sh logs
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   ./setup.sh
   
   # Windows
   setup.bat
   ```

2. **Development**:
   ```bash
   # Start development environment
   ./dev.sh start
   
   # Access application
   # Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   # API: http://localhost/api
   ```

3. **Production Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to production
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

## üìù Notes

- All scripts include error handling and colored output
- Scripts automatically detect Docker Compose command (old vs new syntax)
- Windows batch files use `timeout` instead of `sleep`
- Production deployment requires `.env.production` file
- Database backups are created with timestamps
