# Cursor Indexing Configuration
# This file controls what Cursor indexes for code intelligence
# IMPORTANT: Only exclude files that would cause performance issues
# ALL source files, config files, documentation, and project files WILL BE INDEXED

# Dependencies - exclude for performance only (these are huge and not useful for indexing)
node_modules/
vendor/
jspm_packages/
.pnp/
.pnp.js

# Build outputs - generated files (these are compiled outputs, not source)
build/
dist/
out/
.next/
.nuxt/
.webpack/
.cache/
.parcel-cache/
.rpt2_cache/
.rts2_cache_cjs/
.rts2_cache_es/
.rts2_cache_umd/
.fusebox/

# Package manager lock files - very large and not useful for code intelligence
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
composer.lock

# Logs - not needed for indexing
*.log
logs/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# NOTE: All other files including:
# - All source files (*.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx, *.php, *.py, etc.)
# - All config files (*.json, *.yaml, *.yml, *.toml, *.ini, etc.)
# - All documentation (*.md, *.txt, etc.)
