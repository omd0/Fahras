# Draft: Project Tracker vs Archiver — Plan Refactor

## Goal
Refactor the old `dev/plan/improve.md` plan (written for Laravel) to fit the current Next.js 16 codebase, grounded in the REAL college workflow at TVTC.

## Current System State (Researched)
- **Tech**: Next.js 16, Prisma, PostgreSQL, NextAuth v5, MUI v7, S3/MinIO
- **Statuses**: draft → submitted → under_review → approved/rejected → completed
- **Admin Approval**: pending → approved/rejected/hidden/needs_revision
- **Milestones**: Fully implemented (templates, statuses, dependencies)
- **Roles**: admin, faculty, student, reviewer
- **Features**: Full CRUD, explore page, bookmarks, notifications, comments, ratings, flags, activity feed, AI metadata, tags
- **Gaps**: Admin approval UI "Coming Soon", no real-time notifications, no bulk operations, no digital credentials

## Brainstorm Ideas (Gemini)
1. "Two-Speed" App (SSG Showroom + dynamic Factory)
2. "Showcase Packet" (video, hero image, elevator pitch, skills)
3. Pre-defined "Project Tracks" (milestone templates per department)
4. "CV Snippet" Generator (auto-format for LinkedIn)
5. Formative Plagiarism Check (student self-check before submission)
6. Verifiable Digital Badges (Open Badges standard)
7. "Skill & Tech" Explorer (structured tag-based discovery)
8. Supervisor "Nudge" Dashboard (proactive alerts)
9. "Request for Comment" Workflow (cross-discipline review)
10. "Industry Problem Bank" (companies submit real problems)
11. "Staged" Data Model (status-based filtering for Factory vs Showroom)
12. "Alumni Connect" (post-graduation networking)
13. Automated Department Reports (analytics dashboard)
14. "Reusable Component" Deliverable (knowledge library)
15. "Public Voting" Showcase Event (annual competition)

## Interview: Real College Workflow

### Requirements (confirmed)
- (awaiting interview)

### Technical Decisions
- (awaiting interview)

### Open Questions
1. What is the REAL step-by-step workflow when a student does a graduation project at your college?
2. Who are the actual actors (teachers, supervisors, committee, dean)?
3. What paperwork/forms/approvals happen at each stage?
4. What happens AFTER the project is defended/graded?
5. Is there a public showcase or exhibition?
6. How are projects stored/archived currently (physically)?

### Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: (to be defined)
- EXCLUDE: (to be defined)
