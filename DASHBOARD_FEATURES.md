### 2. Public Dashboard (`/explore`)

**Purpose**: Allow unauthenticated users to browse published graduation projects

**Key Features**:
- No authentication required
- Shows only approved and public projects

  - `is_public === true`

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
web/src/
├── config/
│   └── dashboardThemes.ts          # Theme configuration for each role
├── components/
│   └── dashboards/
│       ├── AdminDashboard.tsx      # Admin-specific dashboard
│       ├── FacultyDashboard.tsx    # Faculty-specific dashboard
│       ├── StudentDashboard.tsx    # Student-specific dashboard
│       └── ReviewerDashboard.tsx   # Reviewer-specific dashboard
├── pages/
│   ├── DashboardPage.tsx           # Main dashboard router
│   └── PublicDashboardPage.tsx     # Public projects viewer
└── App.tsx                          # Route configuration
```

### Theme Configuration (`dashboardThemes.ts`)

The `dashboardThemes.ts` file defines:
- Color schemes for each role
- Gradient configurations
- Role-specific information (title, subtitle, icon, greeting)
- Helper functions to get theme based on user role

```typescript
export const getDashboardTheme = (roles: Array<{ name: string }> | undefined): DashboardTheme
export const getRoleInfo = (role: string)
```

### Dashboard Routing Logic

The `DashboardPage` component automatically routes users to their role-specific dashboard based on priority:
1. Admin (highest priority)
2. Faculty
3. Student
4. Reviewer (lowest priority)

### Routes Added

| Route | Access | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/explore` | Public | Browse published projects without login |
| `/dashboard` | Protected | Role-specific dashboard (auto-routed) |

## UI/UX Highlights

### Consistent Features Across Dashboards
- Gradient hero headers with role-specific colors
- Statistics cards with icons and gradients
- Quick action buttons
- Recent/relevant projects grid
- Smooth hover animations and transitions
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Material-UI v7 components

### Unique Elements Per Role

**Admin**: Management controls, approval workflows
**Faculty**: Advising projects, team visualization
**Student**: Project creation emphasis, progress tracking
**Reviewer**: Evaluation tools, rating features

### Public Dashboard Unique Features
- No authentication barrier
- Search-first design
- Statistics overview
- Call-to-action for registration
- Professional public-facing UI

## Data Handling

All dashboards follow safe data handling patterns:
- Array fallbacks: `(items || []).map(...)`
- Optional chaining: `user?.roles?.some(...)`
- API error handling with try-catch-finally
- Loading states with CircularProgress
- Empty state messages with helpful CTAs

## Styling Approach

- CSS-in-JS using Material-UI `sx` prop
- Gradient backgrounds using linear-gradient
- Box shadows for depth (0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08))
- Border radius: 3 (12px) for modern look
- Hover animations: translateY(-2px) and shadow increase
- Transition: all 0.3s ease

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Dashboard customization (users can choose themes)
2. Widget drag-and-drop arrangement
3. More detailed analytics charts
4. Real-time updates using WebSockets
5. Export dashboard data to PDF
6. Customizable stats cards
7. Dark mode variants for each theme
8. Dashboard preferences saved to backend

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test role switching (user with multiple roles)
2. Test public dashboard without authentication
3. Test search functionality on public dashboard
4. Test responsive design on mobile devices
5. Test loading states and error handling
6. Test with empty data sets
7. Test project filtering and statistics calculations

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Material-UI v7 requirements
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- ES6+ JavaScript features

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of dashboard components
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Minimal API calls (fetch once per page load)
- Client-side filtering for search (no API calls per keystroke)
- Optimized images and icons
